Here’s a short explanation of the code and its 
components : 
1. Entities: 
o Each class (Advisor, Client, Portfolio, Security) represents a table in the 
database. 
o Annotated with @Entity to specify that they are part of the database schema. 
2. Primary Key: 
o Each entity has an id field annotated with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy 
= GenerationType.IDENTITY), which auto-generates unique identifiers. 
3. Relationships: 
o @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @OneToOne define how the entities are 
connected. 
▪ Advisor ↔ Clients: One advisor manages many clients. 
▪ Client ↔ Portfolio: Each client has one portfolio. 
▪ Portfolio ↔ Securities: Each portfolio can have many securities. 
4. Columns: 
o Fields annotated with @Column represent database columns. 
o Attributes like nullable = false ensure data integrity by enforcing required 
fields. 
5. Constructors: 
o Each entity includes a no-argument constructor (required by JPA) and a 
parameterized constructor for initialization. 
6. Getters and Setters: 
o These allow other parts of the application to interact with the entity fields 
safely. 
7. Cascade & Orphan Removal: 
o CascadeType.ALL ensures that related entities are automatically persisted or 
removed when the parent entity is updated or deleted. 
o orphanRemoval = true removes dependent child entities if they are 
disassociated. 
This setup reflects a well-designed data model with clear relationships and proper annotations 
for JPA/Hibernate to map Java classes to database tables effectively.
